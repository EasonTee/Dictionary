#Hi Eason here, wish to create a dictionary web app which load json file from my hard disk. This is my first project with python flask.

28-Jan-19 latest update: I have completed the dictionary web app. It has some features:
1) Convert all normal words to lower case in case user input capital letters to match the keys in json file
2) Able to capitalize any name, like germany > Germany
3) Able to detect non English words by using python error handling, eg: numbers and symbols
4) Able to suggest 3 closest word by using Python difflib modules when user misspell
5) Redirect to error 404 page when user purposely search for suggest url.

Reminder: my json file is saved in E drive, please check the path for the json file
